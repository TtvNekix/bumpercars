# nek_bumpercars

This is my bumper cars script for ESX Legacy.

This script is fully adapted to OneSync Infinity and can be used without any problem.

Â¡IMPORTANT!
Vehicle and map were downloaded here: https://www.gta5-mods.com/maps/car-bumper-funny-mapping/download/90375
You can use your own maps and cars, only change the config file.
